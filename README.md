# Airbnb Price & Customer Satisfaction Prediction

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict two key factors for Airbnb listings:
1. **Price** â€“ Estimating the listing price based on various features such as geographic location, property characteristics, and amenities.
2. **Customer Satisfaction** â€“ Predicting guest satisfaction scores using factors like host response rate, neighborhood quality, and previous reviews.

To achieve this, we built a robust pipeline that includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment through a **Streamlit web application**.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Merged multiple datasets, removed outliers, and handled missing values.
- Engineered features such as location-based metrics, listing amenities, and host quality scores.
- Applied **MinMax Scaling** and **OneHot Encoding** for model compatibility.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identified key drivers of price and customer satisfaction.
- Visualized trends across different cities, property types, and host behaviors.
- Used correlation matrices to understand feature relationships.

### 3. Hypothesis Testing
- Analyzed if location, property type, and review scores significantly impact price and satisfaction.
- Used **t-tests** and **ANOVA** to validate statistical assumptions.

### 4. Machine Learning Models

#### **Price Prediction Models**
- Linear Regression
- Bagging
- Random Forest Regressor
- Adaptive Boosting (**Best performance but overfitted**)
- Gradient Boosting

#### **Customer Satisfaction Models**
- Linear Regression
- Bagging
- Random Forest Regressor
- Adaptive Boosting (**Best performance but overfitted**)
- Gradient Boosting

- **Evaluated models based on RMSE, RÂ², and classification metrics.**

### 5. Model Deployment
- Saved best models as `.pkl` files for deployment.
- Built **Streamlit web apps** to allow users to input features and get predictions.

## Results & Insights
- **Location and property type** were the strongest predictors of price.
- **Host response rate, cleanliness, and number of reviews** significantly influenced customer satisfaction.
- **Adaptive Boosting models outperformed** traditional regression/classification models.
- **The deployed Streamlit apps provide an easy-to-use interface** for real-time predictions.

## How to Use the Web App
1. Visit the **Streamlit app link** (provided in slides).
2. Input listing details (e.g., location, characteristics of the listingâ€¦).
3. Get an instant **price and customer satisfaction score prediction**.

## Future Improvements
- **Correcting overfitting** in some models and evaluating new RÂ² scores for improved accuracy.
- **Adding real-time market data integration** (e.g., Airbnb API).
